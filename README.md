# rm3 Tag Control

I can guarantee this isn't yet useful.

It will eventually be a linked data (I'm avoiding using the word RDF : ) ) tagging UI in React.

## Targets

* `npm run build` - will use babel to transpile jsx and es6 code to plain es5 javascript to the `dist` folder
* `npm start` - starts a web server at `http://localhost:9000` with a single page app that will require your already transpiled react module.
* `npm test`  - will use mocha to run all `rm3-tag-control/test` files
